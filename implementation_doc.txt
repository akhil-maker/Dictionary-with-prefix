Trie Implementation
This project is implemented by the backend of 'trie' data structure. 
Trie data structure is commonly referred to as 'prefix tree' or 'digital tree'.
It is utilized for finding specific keys from inside a set. The keys are all the more frequently strings, 
with joins between hubs characterized not by the whole key, but rather by individual characters.
A trie or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to proficiently store and recover keys in a dataset of strings.
